INGREDIENTS:
4 thick slices of sourdough bread
-- Avocado Spread
2 avocados
1/4 cup mayonaise
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp freshly ground pepper
2-3 tsp garlic chili paste (optional)
-- Toppings
4 eggs
3 pats of butter
Microgreens/sprouts to garnish (I used a spicy radish/clover mix)
<a href="/recipes/pickled-tomatoes.html">Pickled garlicy tomatoes</a>, drained of brine


DIRECTIONS:
Mash all ingredients for the avocado spread in a medium bowl.
Pan fry bread in 2 pats of butter, coating both sides with all of the butter in the pan. Remove from pan.
Melt remaining pat of butter in pan, and fry eggs to your liking.
While eggs are frying, divide avocado spread among the four pieces of toast. There should be a good amount on each piece.
When eggs are done, place one on each toast. Season with salt and pepper.
Top eggs with pickled garlicy tomatoes and microgreens.

NOTES:
You can leave the avocado slightly chunky if you would like, or mash until smooth.
I do a few minutes on one side, then flip and cook for about 30 seconds, which leaves you with a slightly gelled but still runny yolk and completely cooked whites.
