PREP: 60 minutes
COOK: 10 minutes
YIELD: 1 crust (double for a two-crust pie)

INGREDIENTS:
1 1/4 cups flour
1/2 tsp salt
1 tbs sugar
1 stick butter, frozen and cubed
1/4 cup ice water

DIRECTIONS:
In a large bowl or food processor, combine flour, salt, and sugar.
With a pastry cutter, cut in ccold butter until butter crumbs are a bit smaller than peas.
Add most of the ice water and mix with fork.
Add remaining ice water until mixture justt holds together when squeezed.
Tip crust into plastic wrap, form into a flat disk and refridgerate for at least one hour.
Let stand on the counter for 5 minutes before rolling.

NOTES:
You may not need all of the water.
Don't worry if there are floury bits in the bottom of the bowl. They will be absorbed when the dough is in the fridge.
If done right, you should see many small pieces of butter in the disk before refridgerating.
